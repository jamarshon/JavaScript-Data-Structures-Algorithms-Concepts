Two HTTP Request Methods: GET and POST
Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: GET and POST.

GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

The GET Method
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request:

/test/demo_form.asp?name1=value1&name2=value2
Some other notes on GET requests:

GET requests can be cached
GET requests remain in the browser history
GET requests can be bookmarked
GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
GET requests have length restrictions
GET requests should be used only to retrieve data

The POST Method
Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the HTTP message body of a POST request:

POST /test/demo_form.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: w3schools.com
name1=value1&name2=value2
Some other notes on POST requests:

POST requests are never cached
POST requests do not remain in the browser history
POST requests cannot be bookmarked
POST requests have no restrictions on data length

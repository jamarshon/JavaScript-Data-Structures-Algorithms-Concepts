HTTP is the protocol of the Web, by which Servers and Clients (typically
browsers) communicate. An HTTP transaction comprises a Request sent by
the Client to the Server, and a Response returned from the Server to the Client.

Every HTTP request and response includes a message header, describing the message. These are processed 
by the HTTPD, and may often be mostly ignored by CGI applications (but see below).

A message body may also be included:
1) A HEAD or GET request sends only a header. Any form data is encoded 
	in an HTTP_QUERY_STRING header field, which is available to the CGI program as an environment variable 
	QUERY_STRING.

2) A POST request sends both header and body. The body typically comprises data entered by a user in a form.

3) A HEAD request does not expect a body in the response.

4) A GET or POST request will accept a response with or without a body,according to the header. 
	The body of a response is typically an HTML document.

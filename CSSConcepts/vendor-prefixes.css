/* The best practise is undisputedly to have the unprefixed property last: */
.foo {
    -moz-border-radius: 10px;    /* Mozilla */
    -webkit-border-radius: 10px; /* Webkit */
    border-radius: 10px;         /* W3C */
}

/*
Whichever is last out of -webkit-border-radius and border-radius will be 
the one that's used.

-webkit-border-radius is the "experimental" property - the implementation may 
contain deviations from the specification. The implementation for border-radius 
should match what's in the specification.

It's preferable to have the W3C implementation used when it's available, to 
help ensure consistency between all the browsers that support it.
